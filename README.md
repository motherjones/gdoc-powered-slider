# A Google Spreadsheet-Powered Slider

A super simple, easy-to-edit slider created from a Google spreadsheet. Move through slides by clicking, using left and right arrow keys, or (on mobile) swiping. Works well as a photo slideshow embedded inline. Here's an example slide from the wild:

<p align="center">
  <img width="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/motherjones/simple-slider/master/img/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot"/>
</p>

## Examples in the Wild

## How it works

*MoJo users:* Before you get started, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/motherjones/story-tools#starting-a-new-project).

In its simplest form, this slider is a collection of slides, where each slide consists of a `title`, `middle image`, and some caption `text`. Accordingly, you'll need to create a Google Spreadsheet with a `title`, `middle image`, and `text` column, filling each row with your story content. We'll go over how to set up and format your spreadsheet below, but here's a snapshot of what the first two rows of your spreadsheet should look like:

|**title**|**middle image**|**text**|
|---|------|----|
|`Baldwin` | `http://assets.motherjones.com/environment/2013/04/baldwin.jpg` | `One of the most popular apples in the US until freakish winter weather in 1933-34 knocked it into obscurity. <span class="credit">USDA</span>`|

**Embed video!** You can embed videos instead of still images by swapping `middle image` for `middle video embed`.

## Set up your Google Spreadsheet

Make a copy of [this template]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AswaDV9q95oZdDZFSWpEZHlNRUlHWmVqa3JqalZsZXc&output=html) and move the copy into the relevant beat folder in the Mother Jones Google Drive. Rename the spreadsheet as you see fit. Change the owner of the spreadsheet to MoJo Data in `Share > Advanced`.

In order for the slider to be able to read your spreadsheet, you'll need to make your new spreadsheet public. Go to `File` and click on `Publish to the web,` then click on `Start publishing`. 

A URL will appear. It will look something like this: 

```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Arenb9rAosmbdG5GWHFXbWJlN1hTR2ZmN3lZMVZkOHc&output=html
```

Copy that link. This is your spreadsheet ID or url, which you will use to connect your spreadsheet to the slider.

## Modify your project files

*MoJo users:* By now you should have a local clone of this project repo on your machine. If you don't, go back and follow [these instructions](https://github.com/motherjones/story-tools#starting-a-new-project).

**In your copy of index.html (required):**

In order to get your data showing up in the slider, you'll need to edit a couple of lines of code in your index.html file. Paste the ID or url you just copied from your spreadsheet, and paste it in the place of public_spreadsheet_url. The code you are looking for in the index.html file looks like this:

```

$('#slideshow').slideshow('public_spreadsheet_url');

```

The code after your changes should look like this:

```

$('#slideshow').slideshow('0Arenb9rAosmbdG5GWHFXbWJlN1hTR2ZmN3lZMVZkOHc');

```

Save your changes. Open up index.html using a web browser and check that your data is showing up in the slider.

**Styling the slider (optional):**

Once you've got your data showing up in the slider, you can consider styling it to your own taste. You're welcome to use our default slider style (found in css/style.css), or add your own CSS. (*MoJo users* will want to stick to the default styles.) 

**Pro Tips:** 

The slider works best if you:

* Keep your image dimensions consistent across slides. Same for your video embed dimensions.

* Keep your captions short, sweet, and consistent in length across slides. 

## Formatting your spreadsheet data

Back to your spreadsheet.

The `title`, `text` columns should have plain text or html. You can add hyperlinks and styled text—for source credits—by wrapping them in <a href=""></a> and <span class="credit"></span>, as shown in the [How it works](https://github.com/motherjones/simple-slider/blob/master/README.md#how-it-works) section.

For images, the cells in your `middle image` column should only have an image URL that ends in .jpg, .png, or .gif, as shown in the example above.

For videos, copy the video's embed code (as shown above) and paste it in the appropriate row under the `middle video embed` column. The embed code will look something like this:

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TZzzXutPfks" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The `source` column is for *MoJo users* when bulletproofing our data and tracking the origin of each row's data, and anyone else is welcome to adopt this practice.

Once you've got the data formatted properly, open your index.html file in a web browser and check that your data is showing up, and the slider is working properly. Once you have it working, you're ready to stage the slider.

## Staging the inline-slider (for MoJo users only)

*MoJo users:* When you're done, upload to s3 and embed in the shell [(follow this how to)](https://github.com/motherjones/story-tools#starting-a-new-project).

## Use JSON instead (optional)

If your prefer, you can store your slider data in a JSON file instead of a Google spreadsheet. Simply model your JSON after this example:

```

var slideshow = jQuery.slideshow([
	{
		backgroundimage: 'http://i.imgur.com/QYMjo.jpg',
		topimage: 'http://i.imgur.com/QYMjo.jpg',
		topvideoembed: '<iframe width="960" height="720" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TZzzXutPfks" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>',
		title: 'Goats and Kittens That Faint',
		middleimage: 'http://i.imgur.com/QYMjo.jpg',
		middlevideooembed: '<iframe width="960" height="720" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TZzzXutPfks" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>',
		text: 'Awwww-inspiring animals',
		bottomimage: 'http://i.imgur.com/QYMjo.jpg',
		bottomvideoembed: '<iframe width="960" height="720" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TZzzXutPfks" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>'
	}	
]);

```
